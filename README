= SQL Reports for Redmine

== Introduction

This is a plugin written for Redmine that allows the display of arbitrary SQL
queries. At the moment, it only displays those queries, there is no way to
create or edit them.

Also, BIG FAT WARNING. By using this module, it is very possible to create
security problems. Reports are visible to all authenticated users, regardless
of whether they would normally be able to view the content or not. Be careful
about the SQL code you put in your queries.
